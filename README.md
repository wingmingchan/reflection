# reflection
A set of folders and JSP pages to display API documentation. Note that the Home link on these pages point to "/chanw/reflection/index.jsp". It may need to be changed according to needs.

How to use this:

1. Create a folder named chanw right inside ROOT
2. Put the reflection folder, containing sub-folders and JSP pages, inside chanw
3. In a browser, navigate to http://myorganiztion.edu:1234/chanw/reflection/, where the first part is the url used to access Cascade, like http://myorganiztion.edu:1234/entity/open.act?id=82b52bc78b7f08ee207c3cbbf01aa0d3&type=format
